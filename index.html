      Hi, I'm Clarisse! I'm a second year computer science student at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/en" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a>. If you're interested, this is my <a href="https://github.com/clarissecheung" target="_blank">GitHub</a>! My favorite color is pink or yellow which you can see below! You should change them to your favorite color :)

    <p>I'm interested in intersecting sustainability initiatives and computer science specifically in reducing the carbon emissions and environmental impacts of cloud computing. <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" target="_blank">Here</a> is an interesting article if you want to learn more about the topic!
